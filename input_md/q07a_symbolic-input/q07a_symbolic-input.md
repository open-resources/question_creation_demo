## Question Text

Write the centripetal force $F_r$ in terms of the mass $m$, velocity $v$, and radius $r$.

Note that it may not be necessary to use every variable. Use the following table as a reference for each variable:

| $Variable$ | Use   |
|----------|-------|
| $m$  | m  |
| $v$  | v  |
| $r$  | r  |
